To animate or interact with this transition, use the fill axis, where '0' represents the default state and '1' means completely filled. This attribute, along with the \"Weight\" axis, influences the icon's visual style.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Weight\"</strong> determines the icon's line thickness, ranging from thin (100) to bold (700). Changes in weight can also slightly alter the icon's overall size.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the <strong>\"Grade\"</strong> feature fine-tunes the thickness more subtly than weight and minimally affects the icon size. This feature is useful in text fonts as well, allowing you to coordinate the thickness of text and icons for a consistent look. For instance, matching a -25 grade in text with the same in icons can reduce visual harshness, while a 200 grade enhances symbol prominence.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Optical Size,\"</strong> which adjusts between 20dp and 48dp, ensures consistent appearance across different icon sizes by varying the stroke weight automatically. This adjustment helps maintain the icon's intended look regardless of scale changes. <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/material-design-icons/master/font/MaterialIcons-Regular.codepoints\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Raw Icon List</strong></a> - <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/icons/google_icons_intro.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Categorized Icon List on W3 School</strong></a>"
